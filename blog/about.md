# About, Arnold Chand

I am a recent graduate of Western Michigan University completing my Masters in Electrical Engineering. My interest includes working with embedded systems, hardware and IoT. As much as I have an abundance of interest and passion in this industry, so is my lack of experience in it - hence I am creative but a nobody.

Hence the creation of this blog, to document and keep track of things I do onwards my professional career as a hardware/embedded engineer. This inculdes guides that I find lacking or just difficult to find online, insights on upcoming technologies or just thoughts on current trends, and just general portfolio projects to showcase.

Checkout my GitHub for my projects and open-source contributions and my LinkedIn for resume.
