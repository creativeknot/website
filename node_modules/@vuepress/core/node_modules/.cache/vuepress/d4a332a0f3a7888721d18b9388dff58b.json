We (three students, including me) chose a hold down clamp that was lying around in the materials lab and completed its design from start to finish. I recreated the big star screw, the bottom screw, the two small pin screws, the nuts, the threading on each of them as well as the threading on the other components for the screws and nuts to fit comfortably.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technologies-2\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#technologies-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Technologies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SolidWorks</li>\n<li>Measurement tools - calipers, rulers, etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/thecreativenobody/au-engr/tree/master/engineering-graphics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Link to animation and presentation<OutboundLink/></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"_2-microprocessor-labs\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_2-microprocessor-labs\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 2.

LED Cube Audio Visualizer - Senior Design project</h3>\n<p>Of course, my senior design project. It was really fun building such a thing as inputting audio and &quot;converting&quot; it into color representing frequency ranges.</p>\n<p>Quick summary, my senior design project was to create a LED cube (4x4x4) and basically the microcontroller will read an input audio signal and will then filter out into three different frequency ranges - highs, mids, lows. Each range is that assigned a color (highs = red, mids = green, lows = blue). So when an audio signal is, for example music, given then it will light up the LED with ever-changing colors in real-time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technologies-4\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#technologies-4\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Technologies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Microcontrollers</li>\n<li>ATMega328</li>\n<li>C Programming Language</li>\n<li>PCB Design (NI Ultiboard)</li>\n<li>Circuit Design (NI Multisim)</li>\n<li>Logic Design (Hand written logic circuit)</li>\n<li>Project Managment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/thecreativenobody/au-engr/tree/master/senior-design-project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Link to presentation<OutboundLink/></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"western-michigan-university\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#western-michigan-university\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Western Michigan University</h2>\n<h3 id=\"_4-modeling-power-assignments\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_4-modeling-power-assignments\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 4. Modeling Power - assignments</h3>\n<p>Assignments that I did in class, you could think of them as projects since they were in total a project workflow. The first one was done in Python, I was given tower configurations and I was to compute the series impedence and the shunt admittance matrix using numpy. The second was written in Matlab, I was to first generate a table from a given COMSOL simulation. Then input the table in a Matlab script to compute the capacitance matrix, and analyze the initial potential distribution of the matrix.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technologies-5\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#technologies-5\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Technologies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>Matlab</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/thecreativenobody/wmu-engr/tree/master/modeling-power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Link to code<OutboundLink/></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"_5-power-electronics-final-project\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_5-power-electronics-final-project\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 5. Power Electronics - Final project</h3>\n<p>Final project that I did in my Power electronics - dynamic controls class. I was to create a controller for a Buck converter but show them in two ways. The first way was to show by building an analog circuit that would control the buck converter. The second way was to use a micro-controller to control the converter - which I used a PID algorithm for that.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technologies-6\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#technologies-6\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Technologies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>C</li>\n<li>Algorithms</li>\n<li>STM32 micro-controller</li>\n<li>Power-pole board</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/thecreativenobody/wmu-engr/tree/master/power-electronics/project-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Link to code<OutboundLink/></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"_6-micro-controllers-projects\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_6-micro-controllers-projects\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 6.

This class had me occupied all day and did not let me rest, there were a lot of things that were covered. But I did enjoy it and it also helped me get used to what it would be like a fast paced environment. There were 2 projects in total that I had to complete. The first was a simple square wave oscilloscope and the second was a assembly belt motor control. Both were written in C in the IAR Workbench.</p>\n<h4 id=\"technologies-7\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#technologies-7\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Technologies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>C</li>\n<li>STM32 micro-controller</li>\n<li>LCD</li>\n<li>CAN</li>\n<li>SPI</li>\n<li>I2C</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/thecreativenobody/wmu-engr/tree/master/micro-controllers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Link to code<OutboundLink/></a></p>\n<hr>\n<QuickAbout/>\n<hr>\n<Footer/>\n</ContentSlotsDistributor>\n",null]}
