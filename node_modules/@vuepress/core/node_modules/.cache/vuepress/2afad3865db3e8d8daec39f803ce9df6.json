My interest includes working with embedded systems, hardware and IoT. As much as I have an abundance of interest and passion in this industry, so is my lack of experience in it - hence I am creative but a nobody.</p>\n<p>Hence the creation of this blog, to document and keep track of things I do onwards my professional career as a hardware/embedded engineer. This inculdes guides that I find lacking or just difficult to find online, insights on upcoming technologies or just thoughts on current trends, and just general portfolio projects to showcase.</p>\n<p>Checkout my GitHub for my projects and open-source contributions and my LinkedIn for resume.</p>\n<hr>\n<Footer/></ContentSlotsDistributor>\n",null]}
